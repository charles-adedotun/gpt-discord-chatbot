# GPT-3.5 Discord Chatbot

This is a Discord chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model to generate responses to user messages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set the necessary environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_API_KEY`: Your Discord API token.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
4. Run the bot using `python bot.py`.

## Usage

To use the bot, send a message in a Discord channel that the bot has access to. The bot will respond with a message generated by the GPT-3.5 language model.

To send a private message to the bot, start your message with a question mark (`?`). For example, to send a message to the bot saying "Hello", send the message `?Hello`.
